## Software and hardware experience

### Programming languages, scripting languages and markup languages

Frequently I am using C/C++, Bash scripting, reStructuredText and Markdown.
Not so often, YAML and Powershell scripting.
Now and then, HTML, CSS and Python.

Used in the past: Assembly (x86, PIC and Z80), Brainfuck, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Lisp, Pascal, PHP, Perl, Python, SQL, Superhack, Textile and some that I forgot about.

### Hardware platforms

Right now I am using ESP32 and STM32.
I have used and played with:

- ATMega and ATTiny - hardware development, software with and without Arduino
- ESP8266 just for testing
- PIC16, PIC18 and PIC32 - hardware development, software in Assembly, C and C++
- Z80 - hardware development, software in Assembly and Basic

## Professional experience
